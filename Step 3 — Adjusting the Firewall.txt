Step 3 — Adjusting the Firewall
If you have the ufw firewall enabled, as recommended by the prerequisite guides, you might need to adjust the settings to allow for SSL traffic. Luckily, Apache registers a few profiles with ufw upon installation.

View the list of available profiles by running the following:

$ sudo ufw app list

The output should be as follows:

Output
Available applications:
  Apache
  Apache Full
  Apache Secure
  OpenSSH

You can review the current setting by checking the status:

$ sudo ufw status

If you allowed only regular HTTP traffic earlier, your output results will be like the following:

Output
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Apache                     ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Apache (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
To allow additional HTTPS traffic, you can allow the “Apache Full” profile and then delete the redundant “Apache” profile allowance:

	$ sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'
	$ sudo ufw delete allow 'Apache'

Confirm the changes by checking the status:
	$ sudo ufw status

Output
Status: active

Sometimes the status doesn't show "active" due to some issues with the previous configurations. Just make sure you add all details, domain name etc. correctly.

--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Apache Full                ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Apache Full (v6)           ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)

You’ve now successfully allowed Apache traffic to your firewall.
