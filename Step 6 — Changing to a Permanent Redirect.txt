Step 6 — Changing to a Permanent Redirect

If your redirect worked correctly and you are sure you want to allow only encrypted traffic, you should modify the unencrypted Apache Virtual Host again to make the redirect permanent.

Open your server block configuration file again:

	$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

Find the Redirect line you added earlier. Add "permanent" to that line, which changes the redirect from a 302 temporary redirect to a 301 permanent redirect:


<VirtualHost *:80>
        . . .

        Redirect permanent "/" "https://your_domain_or_IP/"

        . . .
</VirtualHost>

Save and close the file.

Check your configuration for syntax errors:

	$ sudo apache2ctl configtest

When you’re ready, restart Apache to make the redirect permanent:

	$ sudo systemctl restart apache2

You’ve successfully made the redirect permanent to allow only encrypted traffic.
