Step 4 — Enabling the Changes in Apache

Now that you’ve made changes and adjusted your firewall, you can enable the SSL and headers modules in Apache, enable your SSL-ready Virtual Host, and restart Apache.

Enable mod_ssl, the Apache SSL module, and mod_headers, which is needed by some of the settings in the SSL snippet, with the a2enmod command:

	$ sudo a2enmod ssl
	$ sudo a2enmod headers

Next, enable your SSL Virtual Host with the a2ensite command:

	$ sudo a2ensite default-ssl

You’ll also need to enable your ssl-params.conf file, to read in the values you set:

	$ sudo a2enconf ssl-params

At this point, your site and the necessary modules are enabled. Check to make sure that there are no syntax errors in your files with a test:

	$ sudo apache2ctl configtest

If everything is successful, you will get the following results:

Output
AH00558: apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message
Syntax OK

The first line is a message telling you that the ServerName directive is not set globally. If you want to get rid of that message, you can set ServerName to your server’s domain name or IP address in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf. This is optional as the message will do no harm.

If your output has Syntax OK in it, your configuration file has no syntax errors. You can now safely restart Apache to implement your changes:

	$ sudo systemctl restart apache2

You’ve made your changes and next you’ll test your SSL server.
